          Unlike version control systems that treat the history is a sacred
          record, in git we can change history to suit our needs. This gives us
          a lot of powerful tools and allows us to curate a good commit history
          in the same way we use refactoring to uphold good software design
          practices.  These tools can be a little bit intimidating to the
          novice or even intermediate git user, but this guide will help to
          demystify the powerful

          <strong>A word of caution</strong>: changing the history of public,
          stable branches is generally advised against. Editing the history of
          feature branches and personal forks is fine, and editing commits that
          you haven't pushed yet is always okay. Use <code>git push -f</code>
          to force push your changes to a personal fork or feature branch after
          editing your commits.

        <h2>Setting up a sandbox</h2>
        <p>
          We don't want to mess up any of your actual repositories, so
          throughout this guide we'll be working with a sandbox repo. Run these
          commands to get started:
        </p>
        <pre>git init /tmp/rebase-sandbox
<!--      -->cd /tmp/rebase-sandbox
<!--      -->git commit --allow-empty -m"Initial commit" <a id="ref-1" href="#note-1"><sup># 1</sup></a></pre>
        <p>
          If you run into trouble, just run <code>rm -rf
            /tmp/rebase-sandbox</code> and run these steps again to start over.
          Each step of this guide can be run on a fresh sandbox, so it's not
          necessary to re-do every task.

        <h2 id="amending">Amending your last commit</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start with something simple: fixing your most recent commit.
          Let's add a file to our sandbox - and make a mistake:
        </p>
        <pre>echo "Hello wrold!" &gt;greeting.txt
<!--      -->git add greeting.txt
<!--      -->git commit -m"Add greeting.txt"</pre>
        <p>
          Fixing this mistake is pretty easy. We can just edit the file and
          commit with <code>--amend</code>, like so:
        </p>
        <pre>echo "Hello world!" &gt;greeting.txt
<!--      -->git commit -a --amend</pre>
        <p>
          Specifying <code>-a</code> automatically stages (i.e. <code>git
            add</code>'s) all files that git already knows about, and
          <code>--amend</code> will <em>squash</em> the changes into the most
          recent commit. Save and quit your editor (you have a chance to change
          the commit message now if you'd like). You can see the fixed commit
          by running <code>git show</code>:
        </p>

        <h2 id="fixup">Fixing up older commits</h2>
        <p>
          Amending only works for the most recent commit. What happens if you
          need to correct an older commit? Let's start by setting up our sandbox
          accordingly:
        </p>
        <pre>echo "Hello!" &gt;greeting.txt
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m"Add greeting.txt"
echo "Goodbye world!" &gt;farewell.txt
git add farewell.txt
git commit -m"Add farewell.txt"</pre>
        <p>
          Looks like <code>greeting.txt</code> is missing "world". Let's write a
          commit normally which fixes that:
        </p>
        <pre>echo "Hello world!" &gt;greeting.txt
git commit -a -m"fixup greeting.txt"</pre>
        <p>
          So now the files look correct, but our history could be better - let's
          use the new commit to "fixup" the last one. For this, we need to
          introduce a new tool: the interactive rebase. We're going to edit the
          last three commits this way, so we'll run <code>git rebase -i
            HEAD~3</code> (<code>-i</code> for interactive). This'll open your
          text editor with something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><!--

<span style="color: grey"># Rebase f5f19fb..0b9d0bb onto f5f19fb (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit
# f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message</span></pre>
        <p>
          This is the rebase plan, and by editing this file you can instruct
          git on how to edit history. I've trimmed the summary to just the
          details relevant to this part of the rebase guide, but feel free to
          skim the full summary in your text editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we save and close our editor, git is going to remove all of these
          commits from its history, then execute each line one at a time. By
          default, it's going to <em>pick</em> each commit, summoning it from
          the heap and adding it to the branch. If we don't edit this file at
          all, we'll end up right back where we started, picking every commit
          as-is. We're going to use one of my favorite features now: fixup. Edit
          the third line to change the operation from "pick" to "fixup" and move
          it to immediately after the commit we want to "fix up":

          speed things up next time.
        </div>
        <p>
          Now save and quit your editor - git will run these commands. We can
          use git log and git show to verify that it worked:
        </p>
        <pre>$ git log -2 --oneline

        <h2 id="squash">Squashing several commits into one</h2>
        <p>
          As you work, you may find it useful to write lots of commits as you
          reach small milestones or fix bugs in previous commits. However, it
          may be useful to "squash" these commits together, to make a cleaner
          history before merging your work into master. For this, we'll use the
          "squash" operation. Let's start by writing a bunch of commits - just
          copy and paste this if you want to speed it up:
        </p>
        <pre>git checkout -b squash
for c in H e l l o , ' ' w o r l d; do
    echo "$c" >>squash.txt
    git add squash.txt
    git commit -m"Add '$c' to squash.txt"
done</pre>
        <p>
          That's a lot of commits to make a file that says "Hello, world"! Let's
          start another interactive rebase to squash them together. Note that we
          checked out a branch to try this on, first. Because of that, we can
          quickly rebase all of the commits since we branched by using <code>git
            rebase -i master</code>. The result:

          <strong>Tip</strong>: your local master branch evolves independently
          of the remote master branch, but your git repo still remembers it as

            rebase -i origin/master</code> is often the most convenient way to

    Add squash.txt with contents "Hello, world"
</pre>
        <p>
          Before we move on, let's pull our changes into the master branch and
          get rid of this scratch one. We can use <code>git rebase</code> like
          we use <code>git merge</code>, but it avoids making a merge commit:
        </p>
        <pre>git checkout master
git rebase squash
git branch -D squash</pre>
        <p>
          We generally prefer to avoid using git merge unless we're actually
          merging unrelated histories. If you have two highly divergent
          branches, a git merge is useful to have a record of when they were
          brought back in sync. In the course of your normal work, rebase is
          often more appropriate.

        <h2 id="rebase">Using git rebase to... rebase</h2>
        <p>
          Ironically, the feature of git rebase that I use the least is the one
          it's named for: rebasing branches. Say you have the following
          branches:
        </p>
        <pre>o--o--o--o--&gt; master
   \--o--o--&gt; feature-1
      \--o--&gt; feature-2</pre>
        <p>
          It turns out feature-2 doesn't depend on any of the changes in
          feature-1, so you can just base it off of master. The fix is thus:
        </p>
        <pre>git checkout feature-2
git rebase master</pre>
        <p>
          Your history now looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>o--o--o--o--&gt; master
   |     \--o--&gt; feature-2
   \--o--o--&gt; feature-1</pre>
